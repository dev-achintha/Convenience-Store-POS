# Convenience-Store-POS (An Academic Mini Project)

A **Java-based Point of Sale (POS)** system designed for small convenience stores, allowing for efficient handling of customer transactions, inventory management, and employee records. This application utilizes **Java Swing** for the user interface and **MySQL** as the backend database.

## Features

- **Login System**: Secure login with at least two user roles (e.g., admin and cashier).
- **Home Screen**: A main menu with relevant sub-menus and images for ease of navigation.
- **Inventory Management**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on inventory data, including products and pricing.
- **Sales Processing**: Process customer transactions, calculate total costs, apply discounts, and handle payments.
- **Employee Records**: Manage employee details, including adding new employees, updating information, and viewing employee lists.
- **Reports**: Generate sales reports and stock status.
- **Database Integration**: The system uses **MySQL** to store all necessary data (e.g., product details, transaction history, and user information).

## Technologies Used

- **Java (Swing)**: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **MySQL**: For database management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Ensuring a modular and scalable codebase.
